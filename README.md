IMPORTANT NOTES
- All done in Xml
- Catkin_make is for ROS 1, we use colcon now
- Never forget to <source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash> , it will not work otherwise
- If you forget where you are, use pwd to find where the files are being made on your windows. They are usually in Linux/Ubuntu-24.04/home/NAME/HERE.
